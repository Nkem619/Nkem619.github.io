        <p>
            Coming to rad5 again is quite exciting to me, having spent my IT months here learning Mobile Development.
            It was a memory  couple of months of study under the care of one of the best tutors/Mobile Developer
            Mr. Peter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After spending so many years trying to figure out some deals with web development
            i can say that my first day in class with Rad5 tech hub was satisfactory, as a lot i knew 
            and the ones i thought i knew was well simplified that even lay man can understand and try web.t
            this gave me hope and courage that yes i am in the right bootcamp and that i'll be thought by a set
            of well experienced Developers and leaders like Mr. Igwe, Mr. Nnanna, Mr. Peter and a couple of other 
            well experienced programmers, not forgetting the host of mates in the class of over 25 persons. 
        </p>
        <h4> Below are the Sample of Assignment from My First Day at RAd5 </h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Send your story to academy@rad5.com.ng</li>
            <li> Research on how a meta tag can improve webpage SEO </li>
            <li> Create a webpage with the lessons learnt so far</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So far so good i can say that RAD5 Tech hub is a good innovation center geared towards 
            grooming future developers, as they pay attention to their students' needs, so as to ensure 
            that quality is delivered. So i will recommend rad5 tech hub to anyone who truely wants
            to walk the path of technology when it comes to programming.
